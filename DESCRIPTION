Description: Fits structural equation models using EM algorithm.  More precisely, 
  the model is a multi-block latent factor model with one structural equation which
  the latent variables are latent factors. The EM approach consists in viewing 
  the latent factors as missing data and using the EM algorithm to maximize 
  the whole model’s likelihood, which simultaneously provides estimators not only 
  of the model’s coefficients, but also of the values of latent factors.
